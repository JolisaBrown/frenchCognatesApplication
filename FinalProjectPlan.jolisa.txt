Project Title:EPIC- Every Person is Capable


Description and Overview

What problem are you trying to solve?

I want to assist people with language learning. Many Americans are monolingual, not because they are 
unable to learn but because language learning has never been presented to them in such a way as to make the 
task manageable. Because of that, many individuals are daunted before they even begin and don't truly try.
My website would try to counteract this national anxiety surrounding languages in hopes of making the endeavor 
of language acquisition more paletable.

Who is your project’s target audience?

My project's primary audience is individuals with a strong basis in english who hope to learn French. Eventually, I would
like to expand the project to include people wanting to learn Spanish as well.

How are you planning to solve this problem? Be specific when talking about the technology and programming 
languages you will use.

I would like to use HTML,Java, Bootstrap, and potentially PHP to execute this project. As of now this is all I believe 
that this will be all that I need. 
________________


Goals


Have reasonable expectations and set clear, quantifiable goals.


What is the minimum that you would like to see completed by next Tuesday?

By next Tuesday I would like to make the program be able to identify lexical similarities between english
and french, and give the user examples of words that have these similarities. I also would like for it to 
define the french or english  words that are presented as similar. I also would like for it to translate
the definitions of the word into the other language as well as keep the original definition.
Afterwards, I would like for it to translate the inputted words in the other language.

What are stretch goals if there is time permitting?

I would like to include modules on rules of how words transform from one language to another.

Competitive Analysis Research


Research at least three other similar applications. Comment on what you like about their application and 
how you would improve it. Include links and screenshots of these applications


One other application that specializes in language learning is Duolingo, which is useful because it creates
a daily curriculum, which helps to hold people accountable in their language learning pursuits.
